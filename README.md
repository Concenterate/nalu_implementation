# nalu_implementation
The research engineers at DeepMind including well known AI researcher, Andrew Trask have published an impressive paper on a 
neural network model that can learn simple to complex numerical functions with great extrapolation (generalisation) ability.

This repository is created to show the Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (**NALU**) implementation in python using **Tensorflow**. 
The code in this repo complements my article on Medium on [NALUs](https://medium.com/@faizanmukardam/simple-guide-to-neural-arithmetic-logic-units-nalu-explanation-intuition-and-code-64bc22605712/). 
If you are new to NALUs, I strongly recommend my post for simple and intuitive explanation.

I have added three python files here.

#### 1. NAC_simple_implementation.py

This file is the implemntation of a simple Neurl Accumulator(NAC) what is able to learn the additive numeric functions such as addition and subtraction.
